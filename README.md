# OMDb API test website for searching movies

This is a simple website that searches the OMDb database for movies stored and displays info, you can search movies either by IMDb ID or searching by name. It displays some information about the movie, like for example the year of release, plot and genre.

Note that this works best __locally__ since IMDb won't let you hotlink their images used for the movie posters.
